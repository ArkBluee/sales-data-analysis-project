# Sales Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing sales data to extract actionable insights. It is part of my data analyst portfolio and demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- Clean and preprocess raw sales data
- Analyze trends, performance, and KPIs
- Visualize insights using charts

---

## Tools Used

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle:  
**[United States E-Goods Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mithil1729/united-states-e-goods-sales)**

It contains order-level e-commerce data including:
- Order ID
- Product
- Category
- Quantity Ordered
- Sales Amount
- Order Date
- City

Note: The cleaned dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`) is tracked using Git LFS due to its size.

## Key Insights (to be updated)

- Highest-selling products and categories
- Monthly sales trends
- Regional sales performance
- Average order value

---

## Status

In progress: Currently working on Microsoft Power BI. The Dashboard will be added in a future update.
